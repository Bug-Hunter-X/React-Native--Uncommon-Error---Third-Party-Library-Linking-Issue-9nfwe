This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that's not properly linked or configured.  For example, imagine you're using a library that requires native modules (like a camera library), but the native code isn't correctly linked to your React Native project. This often happens during development or after updating your project.  The error manifest may vary, but often involves issues with `requireNativeComponent`, missing modules, or general runtime errors related to the library's functionality.
