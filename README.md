# React Native Uncommon Error: Third-Party Library Linking Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky error in React Native development: problems with linking third-party libraries that require native modules. The error can manifest in various ways, often related to missing modules or failures during the linking process.

## Problem
The example uses a hypothetical library ('react-native-hypothetical-camera') to illustrate the issue.  The core problem is that the native modules provided by the library aren't correctly integrated into your React Native application.  This can lead to runtime errors, crashes, or simply the absence of the library's functionality.

## Solution
The solution usually involves verifying that the third-party library is correctly installed and linked. This often includes:

* **Checking installation steps:** Make sure you followed all the installation instructions provided by the library. This may include running specific commands, modifying native project files, or linking manually.
* **Cleaning and rebuilding:** Sometimes, the linking process becomes corrupted.  Cleaning and rebuilding the project can help resolve inconsistencies.
* **Checking native project files:**  Inspect the native Android (`.gradle`) and iOS (`.xcodeproj`) files to verify that the library's native code is correctly integrated.
* **Using the library's debugging tools:** Many libraries include specific debugging aids or diagnostic steps to pinpoint linking errors. Consult the library's documentation for help.
